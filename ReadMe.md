## Implementation 
- ### Node
Node has two container one of which stores data and other one store a reference to next node in a list.

- ### Linked List
A linked list is a linear collection of data elements(Nodes) and order of Nodes is base on each Node pointing to next Node.

- ### Queue
Queue is a linear data structure which follows the First in, First Out Principle (FIFO) which mainly uses Nodes for storing and connecting data.

- ### Stack
Stack is a linear data structure which follows the First in, Last Out Principle (FILO) which mainly uses Nodes for storing and connecting data.

- ### HashTable
HashTable is a data structure that implements a set abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index, also called a hash code, into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.
